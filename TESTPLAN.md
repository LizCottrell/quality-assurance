# Test Plan - CNN.com

Break down CNN.com into pages + features for testing 

e.g. home page: 
* navigation
* ad-space
* print news
* video news
* more from CNN
* photos
* paid partner content
* eCommerce guide by CNN underscored
* in case you missed it
* footer

## Key workflows (outline)

* Using search to find articles on topics of interest
* Browsing news, clicking into articles and getting back to home screen

## Specific tasks users will complete

* Browse news
* Read articles
* Watch video content

## Assumptions or dependencies

E.g.: “If the website edition is Arabic, then the search feature will only search the Arabic site.”

## Browsers/platforms/devices

List everything within scope

## Testing for *usability*
* Check all internal and external links, phone numbers, and spelling.
* Test form validation. E.g.:
  * What is required vs. optional? 
  * Can you enter anything in the email address or zip code field? 
  * If the application stops you from advancing, is there clear direction?
* Click through all navigation, including breadcrumbs
* Keep visual consistency in mind as you’re testing. E.g. look at how buttons and links are styled, compare from page to page or tool to tool.
* Test atypical scenarios and for error checking. E.g. what happens if you don’t enter a search term and click Search?
* Ask questions: e.g. “Is this intuitive?” or “How much do I need to read or remember to move forward?”

## QA
