# Test Plan - CNN.com

Break down CNN.com into pages + features for testing 

e.g. home page: 
* navigation
* ad-space
* print news
* video news
* more from CNN
* photos
* paid partner content
* eCommerce guide by CNN underscored
* in case you missed it
* footer

## Step 1 - Design QA

## Step 2 - Functional QA

## Step 3 - Accessibility QA

Regression testing (make sure no other features were unintentionally broken after fixes)
